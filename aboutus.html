    <h2>WHO WE ARE:</h2>
    <p>At the heart of our farm is a story of love, rooted in legacy, hard work and livestock. </p>

      <p>  It all began with a man with a dream , a belief in the power of hard work, the joy of family and the importance of good food on the table always. Godfred Lartey-Ayi Laryea (AKA Ghandi) was an engineer with a heart for his family and community. </p>

    <p> Though his work often kept him away from home his love for the land and for farming led him to engage in a lot of small-scale farming activities. He didn’t have acres of land a fleet of tractors. What he had was the passion and belief in that even the smallest farm could feed more than just stomachs but souls as well. </p>

     <p> Years after he passed his children and grandchildren came together to keep his legacy and memory alive in a new way- by building a pig farm that would raise the bar for pork quality in Ghana.</p>

      <p> Today, G.L Heritage Farms; a small sustainable pig farm is proud to be known for producing some of the best pork in Ghana. Built on the values Ghandi held dear and every pig we raise is a tribute to his spirit well cared for, well fed and raised with respect.  No shortcuts. No compromise, just real good pork you can trust. </p>

      <p>  Whether you’re a home cook, a food vendor, or a restaurant looking consistently excellent pork, G.L Heritage Farm is your go to. From our Farm to your flame, we bring you the finest pork products Ghana has to offer. </p>
